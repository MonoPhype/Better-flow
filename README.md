Enter your Tor file path in `config.py`. That's Tor itself, not the browser.  
  - `~/tor-browser_en-US/Browser/TorBrowser/Tor/tor`

Put Youtube/Twitch/Bitchute channel URLs in `>Enter channel urls<`.  
Not every line has to be a URL.  

Run `scrape.py`

Uploads from specified channels are in `subsc.html`.

Recommended Youtube videos are in `recom.html`.
